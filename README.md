# Safwaan Sohail

Student developer focused on building end-to-end systems across data engineering, automation, and software infrastructure. I enjoy creating practical tools â€” from command-line apps that streamline developer workflows to intelligent, data-driven systems that process information in real time.

My projects typically sit at the intersection of software engineering, data science, and embedded systems. I value clarity, efficiency, and solving problems from first principles.
